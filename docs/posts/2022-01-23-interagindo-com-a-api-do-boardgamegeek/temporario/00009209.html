						               													<description>With elegantly simple gameplay, Ticket to Ride can be learned in under 15 minutes. Players collect cards of various types of train cars they then use to claim railway routes in North America. The longer the routes, the more points they earn. Additional points come to those who fulfill Destination Tickets &amp;ndash; goal cards that connect distant cities; and to the player who builds the longest continuous route.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;The rules are simple enough to write on a train ticket &amp;ndash; each turn you either draw more cards, claim a route, or get additional Destination Tickets,&amp;quot; says Ticket to Ride author, Alan R. Moon. &amp;quot;The tension comes from being forced to balance greed &amp;ndash; adding more cards to your hand, and fear &amp;ndash; losing a critical route to a competitor.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Ticket to Ride continues in the tradition of Days of Wonder's big format board games featuring high-quality illustrations and components including: an oversize board map of North America, 225 custom-molded train cars, 144 illustrated cards, and wooden scoring markers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Since its introduction and numerous subsequent awards, Ticket to Ride has become the BoardGameGeek epitome of a &amp;quot;gateway game&amp;quot; -- simple enough to be taught in a few minutes, and with enough action and tension to keep new players involved and in the game for the duration.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Part of the Ticket to Ride series.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

Very easy to teach (took like 2 minutes to have everyone know all the rules).

			<comment username="Socal Tim" rating="10" value="One of the only games I knew I would like just after opening the box and reading the rules.  Simple to learn, fun to play for gamers and newcomers, and many strategic options.  Not a &quot;ten&quot; only because the initial card draw can play too large a role, especially if someone has two or three tickets with cities that interrelate, i.e. you complete Seattle to New York and you also have a second card with Seattle that is completed along the way. Update: you can overcome poor draws, so bump it to ten!" />

			<comment username="Chris Schreiber" rating="10" value="I have come to really appreciate the game for the addictive joy that it is. It is a great gateway because it&apos;s simple, beautiful, and has a very positive first play experience. But please stop saying this is &quot;just&quot; a gateway game. Yes, it is an amazing game to introduce people to the hobby, but it is more than a simple game when experienced players sit down to play. Deep? Maybe not, but fully engaging to a player choosing to track every detail.  

I do think in every way that it is a landmark for the hobby and that was clear from the very beginning. My first set of cards are nearly ragged. And sharing it with my students was a great joy. 

The tension can be palpable with some groups, and yet I can play loose with others. I love that range of experience based on my fellow players. Those who say it is all luck fail to regard how you can play your way out of any hand by knowing the game and watching the other players. The best players win much, much more often---but not so much that a new player can&apos;t pull a game out. The group I play this with make me proud to play games because anyone can win and people can still play with a personal style. That&apos;s a very high compliment in my book!

			<comment username="NeilGordon" rating="10" value="This game never fails to be a winner, almost everyone who we play this with goes out and gets themselves a copy.

Good duration (30-45mins), plays well with 2, easy to explain and learn for beginners, tense start to finish (building quickly towards the end),  enough luck that beginners have a chance, while still allowing strategies to support a good score.

Highly recommended as a gateway game and as a gift." />

			<comment username="dtolman" rating="10" value="This is an excellent game - in some ways it really reminded me of TranAmerica:
-hidden goal cards 
-connecting cities
-color coded player rails (not in TransAmerica)

but with a lot more added strategy
-no shared player networks
-limited links between cities
-must pay to create longer links
-bigger and bigger rewards for successfully completing larger links

Not only that - it plays very quickly - a lot of fun in a nice tidy little package." />
			<comment username="wilsonx81" rating="10" value="My grandfather worked on trains for 60 years, I got it in my blood, when I first looked the front cover of the box I just had to buy it.

Good thing that I did, because the game is seriously fun! I love the strategy and random elements, not to mention all the train minis ^_^" />

Skeptical and confused at first.  Amazed and wanting to play again when the game is over.

			<comment username="bop517" rating="10" value="I love rail games, but Rail Baron, Empire Builder and the like are very long.  This one is short, quick, and tense. Still my favorite of the three TtR&apos;s. 

Or however many there are now.  LOL

I dropped to an 8 as I don&apos;t think as highly of it.  It is a great gateway and a game every now and again is always fun.  The ticket draw can be luck and it can decide games.  That is sort of meh to me.

November 2014 - played a couple more times since that last comment.  It settles in at a 9.  " />
